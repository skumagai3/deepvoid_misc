# DeepVoid Loss Function Improvements - Summary

## Problem Identified
Your model was heavily biased toward predicting "Wall" instead of "Void" due to:
- Extremely high `void_penalty=8.0` in SCCE_Class_Penalty
- High `minority_boost=3.0` making wall an attractive default
- No penalty for wall over-prediction

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated NETS_LITE.py
Added new improved loss functions in a dedicated section:

- **SCCE_Class_Penalty_Fixed**: Balanced version with reduced penalties
  - void_penalty: 2.0 (was 8.0)
  - wall_penalty: 1.0 (new)
  - minority_boost: 2.0 (was 3.0)

- **SCCE_Proportion_Aware**: Encourages matching target class proportions
  - Uses your actual data distribution [0.65, 0.25, 0.08, 0.02]
  - Penalizes deviation from expected proportions

### 2. Updated curricular.py
- Added new loss function choices: SCCE_Class_Penalty_Fixed, SCCE_Proportion_Aware
- Reduced parameters in existing SCCE_Class_Penalty
- Added proper custom objects for model serialization

### 3. Updated curricular_pred.py
- Added new loss functions to CUSTOM_OBJECTS for model loading compatibility

### 4. Removed separate file
- Consolidated all loss functions in NETS_LITE.py as requested
- Removed improved_loss_functions.py

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Use the fixed class penalty (recommended)
```bash
python curricular.py /content/drive/MyDrive/ 4 16 SCCE_Class_Penalty_Fixed --BATCH_SIZE 8 --USE_ATTENTION --LAMBDA_CONDITIONING --L_VAL 10
```

### Option 2: Use proportion-aware loss
```bash
python curricular.py /content/drive/MyDrive/ 4 16 SCCE_Proportion_Aware --BATCH_SIZE 8 --USE_ATTENTION --LAMBDA_CONDITIONING --L_VAL 10
```

### Option 3: Use standard SCCE (simplest)
```bash
python curricular.py /content/drive/MyDrive/ 4 16 SCCE --BATCH_SIZE 8 --USE_ATTENTION --LAMBDA_CONDITIONING --L_VAL 10
```

## Expected Improvements
- Model should properly predict voids as the dominant class (65.1%)
- Reduced wall over-prediction bias
- Better minority class (filament/halo) detection
- More balanced confusion matrix

The loss function improvements are now integrated into your existing codebase and ready for training!
